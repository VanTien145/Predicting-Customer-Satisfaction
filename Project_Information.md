### Project Information

- **Team size:** 3 members

- **Description:** We have built a model to predict whether customers are satisfied with our airline service (From a hypothetical dataset about the airline company named Invistico_Airline)

- **Responsibilities:** 
  - Search for suitable labeled datasets aimed at building a classification prediction model.
  - Extract useful insights from the dataset through EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) by examining descriptive statistics (min, max, median, mode, mean, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.) and visualizing charts such as histograms and box plots.
  - Perform the following steps: Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers from the quartile analysis) → Normalization (using one-hot encoding & min-max scaling) → Feature transformation to optimize the model's learning, followed by handling imbalanced data to avoid biased model results.
  - Build classification models such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, etc.
  - Evaluate the model using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and then draw conclusions.
  - Achieved results: The models achieved fairly accurate prediction results, ranging from 85% to 95%.

- **Programming :** Python
